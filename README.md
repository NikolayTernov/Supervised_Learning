Greeting, dear Reviewer.
Here you can find my project with 4 commits (from standard one "as it is" to some minor changings).
Unfortunately, I can't understand why git uploaded the whole folder, but I suppose it won't provide you any inconvinience.
I set "master" as default to avoid some problems on my PC.
